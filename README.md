# Digital-clock
This is a digital clock implemented using Arduino on Tinkercad.
It displays time in the format HH:MM:SS with month and date at right-bottom corner.

The final design view is as follows:

We have included 3 push-buttons which are used to set the time and increment or decrement of time. When we hold set button for a second, clock goes into setting mode. We can first change hours, then minutes and finally date and month. After that we can come back to clock mode by pressing set button once.

Views of project at different instants are as follows:
